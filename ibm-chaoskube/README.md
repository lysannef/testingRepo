# Chaoskube Helm Chart

## Introduction
[chaoskube](https://github.com/linki/chaoskube) periodically kills random pods in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Note 
The original work for this helm chart is present @ [Helm Charts]( https://github.com/helm/charts) Based on the [chaoskube]( https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/chaoskube) chart

```console
$ helm install stable/ibm-chaoskube
```
## Resources Required
The chart deploys pods consuming minimum resources as specified in the resources configuration parameter (default: Memory: 200Mi, CPU: 100m)

## Chart Details
Chaoskube Helm Chart which periodically kills random pods in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites 
- Kubernetes 1.7+
- Tiller 2.7.2 or later
 
## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm install --name my-release stable/ibm-chaoskube
```

The command deploys chaoskube on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The configuration section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the my-release deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

By default `chaoskube` runs in dry-run mode so it doesn't actually kill anything.
If you're sure you want to use it run `helm` with:

```console
$ helm install stable/ibm-chaoskube --set dryRun=false
```

| `timezone`                | Set timezone for running actions (Optional)         | "" (UTC)                          |
| `excludedWeekdays`        | Set Days of the Week to avoid actions (Optional)    | "" (Don't skip any weekdays)      |

Setting label and namespaces selectors from the shell can be tricky but is possible (example with zsh):

```console
$ helm install \
  --set labels='app=mate\,stage!=prod',namespaces='!kube-system\,!production' \
  stable/ibm-chaoskube --debug --dry-run | grep -A7 args
    args:
    - --interval=10m
    - --labels=app=foo,stage!=prod
    - --namespaces=!kube-system,!production
    - --timezone=America/New_York
    - --excludedWeekdays="Sat,Tue"
    - --excludedTimesOfDay="12:00-18:00"
    - --excludedDaysOfYear="Apr1,Dec24"
```
## Limitations

## NOTE
This chart has been validated on ppc64le.
